          <h2>Newgrove History</h2>
          <p>By the end of the nineteenth century, Newgrove was declared a fishing town, as it was located in a privileged area, near a river and the sea. The town grew quickly in population and size as it shifted from an agricultural society to an industrial power, allowing faster production and delivery to other points of the estate and the country. Starting in the twentieth century, the city saw an influx of immigrants seeking job opportunities and a better life. In the latter half of the twentieth century and into the present, students from all corners of the globe have begun arriving to enjoy both a quality education and a lively city, evolving Newgrove into a college town. Despite this, it remains one of the most powerful fishing points in the estate, featuring an impressive dock area and an abundant source of river and sea fish.</p>
