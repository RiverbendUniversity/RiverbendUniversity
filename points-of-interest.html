            Discover the must-see places in Newgrove! Our city is full of cultural, recreational, and scenic landmarks:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Would you like a cup of coffee? Visit Steam & Honey, one of Newgrove's most well-known cafés, popular with students and residents who come to study or simply want to enjoy a calm stay.</li>
            <li>Both the name of the area and of the most popular nightclub in the city, The Heights, represent money and exclusivity in Newgrove. This central neighborhood is known as the nightlife district in the evening and the wealthiest residential spot during the day, housing the tallest and most modern high-rises in the city.</li>
            <li>In need of something? Silverleaf Mall, our most recently built mall, features chic clothing stores, diverse and delicious restaurants, and even a pond area with Koi fish. Whether you're shopping or meeting friends, the mall is your top choice!</li>
            <li>As Newgrove’s economy gradually diversified and the fishing industry receded in importance at the end of the twentieth century, the city underwent a significant transformation. Former warehouses and factories have been transformed into sites of cultural production, including art studios, music venues, and craft breweries. Ironworks, now recognized as among the city’s most fashionable districts, embodies concepts of artistic expression and creativity.</li>
            <li>Are you in for a little walk? Try one of the many jogging trails available around the park. Are you a fan of music festivals? Enjoy our outdoor concerts in the amphitheater. Echo Park is the perfect place to spend a wonderful day!</li>
